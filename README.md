# LSPFuzz: Hunting Bugs in Language Servers

LSPFuzz is a grey-box hybrid fuzzer that generates test cases for [Language Servers](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).
It is implemented based on [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL).

## What is this?

> The language server crashed five times in the past three minutes.

> The code completions are suddenly gone when I was typing.

Sound familiar? It should! Bugs in language servers can cause interruptions in your development workflow, even when you haven't done anything wrong. LSPFuzz is designed to automatically find such bugs before they are shipped to you.

## Technical Details

LSPFuzz is equipped with a two-stage mutation pipeline that produces valid yet diverse inputs to trigger various analysis routines in LSP servers.

## Usage

### Preparation

1. Prepare a fuzz target compatible with [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).
   It is highly recommended to use [LTO mode](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/instrumentation/README.lto.md) and [persistent mode](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/instrumentation/README.persistent_mode.md).
   The following is an annotated template for a fuzz target:

   ```c++
   #include "your_header_file.h"

   #ifndef __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_LEN
       // The following definitions allow compilation without the AFL++ compiler.
       ssize_t fuzz_len;
       #define __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_LEN fuzz_len
       const uint8_t fuzz_buf[1024000];
       #define __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_BUF fuzz_buf
       #define __AFL_FUZZ_INIT() void sync(void);
       #define __AFL_LOOP(x) ((fuzz_len = read(0, fuzz_buf, sizeof(fuzz_buf))) > 0 ? 1 : 0)
       #define __AFL_INIT() sync()
   #endif

   __AFL_FUZZ_INIT();

   int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {

       #ifdef __AFL_HAVE_MANUAL_CONTROL
         __AFL_INIT();
       #endif

       // [Initialization]
       // Perform one-time initialization for the target LSP server.
       // Or call `LLVMFuzzerInitialize(argc, argv)` here.

       const uint8_t *buf = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_BUF;
       while (__AFL_LOOP(10000)) {
           ssize_t len = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_LEN;
           // [Input Processing]
           // Process an input here:
           //   1. Read `len` bytes from `buf` for LSP inputs, as if they were read from `stdin`.
           //   2. Process the LSP inputs. Note that the input contains the `Content-Length` header.
           //   3. Release resources and reset states.
           // Or call `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(buf, len)` here.
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Obtain the coverage map size:

   ```bash
   AFL_DUMP_MAP_SIZE=1 ./fuzz-target
   ```

3. Mine code fragments for code generation:

   ```bash
   lsp-fuzz-cli mine-code-fragments \
     --search-directory <code-dir> \ # Directory containing code files of the target language for the LSP servers
     --output <fragment-output> # File to store the mined code fragments
   ```

> [!CAUTION]
> Although persistent mode can significantly improve fuzzing efficiency, users need to ensure that resources are properly released and states are reset in the fuzzing loop.

### Start Fuzzing

```bash
lsp-fuzz-cli fuzz \
  --state <state-dir> \ # Directory to store the fuzzing state (e.g., generated inputs, found crashes)
  --lsp-executable <fuzz-target> \ # Executable file of the LSP server fuzz target
  --language-fragments Language=<fragment-output>\ # Comma-separated list of files containing the mined code fragments, (e.g., `C=c.frag,CPlusPlus=cpp.frag`)
  --coverage-map-size <coverage-map-size> \ # Size of the coverage map to use for coverage-guided fuzzing
  --time-budget 24 # Time budget for fuzzing in hours
```

To learn more about the options, run `lsp-fuzz-cli fuzz --help`.

### Reproduce Detected Crashes

1. Export the generated crash-triggering inputs:

   ```bash
   lsp-fuzz-cli export \
     --input <state-dir>/solutions \ # Directory containing the generated crash-triggering inputs
     --output <export-directory> # Directory to store the exported crash-triggering inputs
   ```

   The contents of `<export-directory>` will be organized as follows:

   ```
   <export-directory>
   ├── <input-id-0>
   │   ├── workspace
   │   │   ├── file1.txt
   │   │   └── file2.txt
   │   └── requests
   │       ├── message_0001
   │       └── message_0002
   ├── <input-id-1>
   │   ├── workspace
   │   │   ├── file1.txt
   │   │   └── file2.txt
   │   └── requests
   │       ├── message_0001
   │       └── message_0002
   └── ...
   ```

   Each directory `<input-id>` represents a unique input generated by LSPFuzz.
   Within each `<input-id>` directory, there are two subdirectories: `workspace` and `requests`.
   The `workspace` directory contains the code files, and the `requests` directory contains the LSP requests that were sent to the LSP server during fuzzing.

2. Feed the exported input to the LSP server:

   To reproduce the crash, `cd` to a directory containing the exported inputs.

   ```bash
   cat requests/* | ./target-lsp-server
   ```

   Note that `target-lsp-server` is the actual LSP server under test, not the fuzz target.
   Make sure it reads requests from `stdin` and the CLI options are properly set.
   To reproduce bugs caught by sanitizers, `target-lsp-server` should be compiled with sanitizers enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not move the exported test cases, because the LSP requests are encoded with _absolute paths_. Moving them will invalidate the requests (analogous to the concept of [pinning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html) in Rust – they are "pinned" to `<export-directory>`).

## Fuzzing JVM Language Servers (Scala)

Native AFL++ instrumentation does not apply to a JVM language server, so LSPFuzz also supports a
JVM-specific path: a bytecode **coverage agent** instruments the server in-process and writes an
AFL-shaped edge map, and a JVM-specific executor drives a persistent worker that hosts the server and
copies that map out (no fork server, no ELF/AFL signatures). Scala is a supported language, and the
target is the Scala 3 BSP/semantic language server. See `docs/jvm-target.md`,
`docs/jvm-coverage-agent.md`, and `docs/jvm-coverage-lifecycle.md` for the design.

Instead of `--lsp-executable`, pass the worker argv with `--jvm-worker` (each token is preserved
verbatim; place it last so its arguments are not consumed as fuzzer flags), and choose the Scala
profile mode with `--scala-mode`:

```bash
lsp-fuzz-cli fuzz \
  --state <state-dir> \
  --scala-mode pc \
  --language-fragments Scala=<fragment-output> \
  --time-budget 24 \
  --jvm-worker java -XX:-UseCompactObjectHeaders -Xshare:off -XX:+UseSerialGC \
    --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -javaagent:<agent.jar> -cp <ls.jar> cov.Worker
```

- `--scala-mode` selects `pc` (presentation compiler) or `index` (BSP-backed index paths).
- `--jvm-worker` must come last, as the parser consumes everything after it as the worker argv.
- The determinism flags (`-XX:-UseCompactObjectHeaders -Xshare:off -XX:+UseSerialGC`) are
  **required** in the worker argv — the launch is rejected without them so the server always fuzzes
  under the stable-coverage configuration (see `docs/jvm-coverage-agent.md`).
- `pc` mode exercises presentation-compiler paths (completion/hover/signatureHelp/definition).
- `index` mode exercises BSP-backed index paths (references/rename/workspace-symbol) over a frozen,
  pre-indexed backdrop and requires `LS_SQLITE_LIB` (the server's pinned native SQLite) and
  `BACKDROP_OUT` (a verified frozen backdrop root; see `docs/zaozi-backdrop.md`).
- The server must run on its **exact pinned JDK** — a foreign JDK build segfaults the server's FFM
  SQLite binding.

### Findings and one-command cold replay

On the JVM path, findings (JSON-RPC error responses and the outcome-oracle classes) are exported as
provenanced bundles under `<state-dir>/solutions/finding-bundles`. Each bundle records the serialized
input plus the provenance needed to reproduce it (LS commit + classpath hash, JDK flags, agent
version/config, frozen-backdrop commit + snapshot / SemanticDB / BSP hashes, native SQLite artifact
hash, profile mode, and timeout budget); export is fail-closed, so a finding without complete
provenance is not written. Provide the provenance via the environment for a real campaign: `LS_COMMIT`,
`LS_CLASSPATH_HASH`, `COV_AGENT_VERSION`, `COV_AGENT_CONFIG`, `JDK_FLAGS`, and (index mode)
`BACKDROP_COMMIT`, `BACKDROP_SNAPSHOT_HASH`, `SEMANTICDB_HASH`, `BSP_HASH`, `SQLITE_ARTIFACT_HASH`.

Replay a finding from a cold JVM through the shipped `ls.core.Main` stdio entrypoint and confirm it
reproduces the recorded outcome class:

```bash
lsp-fuzz-cli cold-replay \
  --bundle <state-dir>/solutions/finding-bundles/<finding>.cbor \
  --ls-jar <ls.jar> \
  --java <pinned-jdk>/bin/java \
  --backdrop-root <backdrop> \
  --output <confirmed>.cbor
```

- `--ls-jar` (or `$LS_JAR`): the server jar / classpath.
- `--java` (or `$LS_JAVA`): the server's exact pinned JDK (a foreign build segfaults its FFM SQLite binding).
- `--backdrop-root` (or `$BACKDROP_OUT`): required for index-mode findings.
- `--output`: optional; write back the confirmed bundle.

The command revalidates the bundle's provenance before replaying, so an incomplete bundle is rejected
up front. A finding that reproduces is marked **confirmed**; one that does not is labelled
**in-process-harness-only** rather than presented as a confirmed server crash.
